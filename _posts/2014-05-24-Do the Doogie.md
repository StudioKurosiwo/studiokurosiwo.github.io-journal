title: Teach me How to Doogie
---

I haven't invented a new [dance craze](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi4_rXSn-lI) nor repackaged and renamed an old one. Doing the Doogie is in reference to that thoroughbred of televisual excellence from the stables of Steven Bochco and David E Kelley, [Doogie Howser MD](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrERtikdPus). In the show about the genius kid doctor, our hero Doogie would diligently sit at his computer near the end of each episode and enter worthy life lessons into his  [personal journal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7FJNdLjLGg). 

I'll try as much as possible to steer away from worthy heartwarming life lessons and instead offer the odd musings on matters great and trivial and all points in between.Televison inspired medical prognosis and consultations will of course also be available, that is if Greg House doesn't hog the CT scanner.
