title: About Sipo
---

<p>Having had my thespian aspirations cruelly quashed at an impressionable age by my inability to land a speaking part in the school play, and being instead saddled with a the role of  an uncoordinated leggings wearing “whirlwind dancer” prancing around (upstage) to Jean Michel Jarre's Oxygene, I found solace when my design was chosen for the play program. Since then design has continued to redeemed and define me. My liaison with design was consummated with a formal education first with an art and design foundation at Camberwell college of arts then a design degree from Goldsmiths University of London.</p>

<p>Away from design I can be found drinking craft beers in the most pretentious way possible or indulging in my other love, film.

Enough about me, what's your story?</p>
